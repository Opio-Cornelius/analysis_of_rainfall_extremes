# Analysis_of_Rainfall_Extremes
NCL and R scripts for analyzing satellite rainfall observations from TRMM and WRF model simulations of extreme rainfall. The scripts deposited here were used to generate the graphics that are presented in my MSc thesis titled **"Examining observed and simulated extreme rainfall events over Lake Victoria Basin in Uganda"** It can be downloaded @ https://wimea-ict.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Opio_thesis_RC1.pdf

A subsection of those results were also presented in this article:
